# coding-challenge

This Repository is created for DataScience coding Challenge.
In this project created a fraud detection algorithm based on the previous connections between users to predict future transactions.
Used methods used in graph_theory to find the shortest path between users and predicted whether the current association is trusted or not.

no additional libraries are used.
